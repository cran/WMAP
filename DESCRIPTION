Description: Implementation of integrative weighting approaches for multiple observational studies and causal inferences. The package features three weighting approaches, each representing a special case of the unified weighting framework, introduced by Guha and Li (2024) <doi:10.1093/biomtc/ujae070>, which includes an extension of inverse probability weights for data integration settings.
